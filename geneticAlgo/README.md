# geneticalgo

This is an implementation of a simple Genetic Algorithm that is described in the Book [Genetic Algorithms in Java Basics](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484203293) by Lee Jacobson and Burak Kanber.
As the title implies all code is written in Java. I wanted to try a different programming language (in this case Crystal) to implement the algorithm. This is a starting point and I'll implement the others as I read along in the book. The Algorithm is explained in detail in Chapter 2 of the book.
