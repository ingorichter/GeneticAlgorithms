# GeneticAlgorithms

This is a collection of Genetic Algorithms that are described in the Book [Genetic Algorithms in Java Basics](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484203293) by Lee Jacobson and Burak Kanber.
The code in the book uses Java. I wanted to try a different programming language (in this case Crystal) to implement the algorithm(s). This is a starting point and I'll implement the other algorithms as I read along in the book.
